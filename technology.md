# Technologies Used
## Data Cleaning and Analysis
Our team will be using Pandas to clean the data and perform an exploratory analysis. Further analysis will be completed using Python and Google Collaboratory.
## Database Storage
PgAdmin is the database we intend to use, and we will integrate Tableau to display the data.
## Machine Learning
Our training and testing setup will be using linear regression to answer our predictive questions. The Machine Learning will also be unsupervised, and neural. SKLearning.Cluster and SKLearn.Decomposition are two of the ML libraries we will be using to create a classifier.
## Dashboard
We will be using Tableau for a fully functioning and interactive dashboard. It will pull a Google API key to create several features including an interactive map.
